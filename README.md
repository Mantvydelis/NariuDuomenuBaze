v0.1:

API stores the information of a organization member to MS SQL database and to .csv file. For now it can add, delete, update and find member by his ID or surname. 

Repositories: using MS SQL for repositoring data and Microsoft Entity Framework for connecting API with database. 

Tests: used xUnit Test for verifying my code functions and mocking repositories with Moq.
